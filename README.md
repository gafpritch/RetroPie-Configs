# RetroPie Configs

Various RetroPie config. files and resources for use with 4:3 ratio and 16:9 ratio displays.  We use these on our various arcade machine builds and retro console builds.  For more info, see the website ...

The main focus for this repository will be the non-standard files and content added to a fairly typical RetroPie setup, as downloaded from RetroPie website.  Included will be a custom theme, based on the detailed view in EmulationStation and various retroarch config. files.

Any info, please get in touch!
